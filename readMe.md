# Decentralized Identity System (DID) Smart Contract

## Overview

This Clarity smart contract provides a robust, privacy-preserving decentralized identity management system for blockchain applications. It enables secure identity creation, credential management, and zero-knowledge proof verification.

## Features

- **Decentralized Identity Creation**
  - Unique identity generation
  - Public key and DID storage
  - Single identity per address

- **Credential Management**
  - Add up to 10 credentials per identity
  - Credential type and verification support
  - Expiration-based credential validity

- **Privacy-Preserving Verification**
  - Zero-knowledge proof mechanism
  - Minimal information disclosure
  - Secure credential checks

## Contract Functions

### Identity Management
- `create-identity`: Create a new decentralized identity
  - Parameters: DID (string), Public Key (compressed)
  - Prevents duplicate identities

### Credential Handling
- `add-credential`: Add a new credential to identity
  - Parameters: Credential Type, Verification Hash, Expiration
  - Limit of 10 credentials per identity

- `verify-credential`: Check credential validity
  - Validates credential type and expiration
  - Returns boolean result

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs
- `verify-zk-proof`: Verify privacy-preserving proofs
  - Simulates ZK proof verification
  - Stores proof verification status

## Use Cases

- Secure dApp Authentication
- Professional Certification Verification
- Age Verification
- Academic Credential Checks

## Technical Requirements

- Stacks blockchain
- Clarity smart contract language
- Compatible wallet (e.g., Hiro Wallet)

## Installation

1. Ensure Stacks development environment is set up
2. Deploy contract using Stacks CLI or web-based deployment tool
3. Interact via supported wallets or development interfaces

## Security Considerations

- Contract limits identity creation to one per address
- Credentials have expiration mechanisms
- Zero-knowledge proof placeholder requires cryptographic implementation

## Error Handling

The contract includes specific error codes:
- `ERR-NOT-AUTHORIZED`: Unauthorized access attempt
- `ERR-IDENTITY-EXISTS`: Duplicate identity creation
- `ERR-IDENTITY-NOT-FOUND`: Identity lookup failure
- `ERR-INVALID-CREDENTIAL`: Credential validation error

## Future Improvements

- Implement advanced ZK proof cryptography
- Add credential revocation mechanism
- Support for more complex credential schemas
- Multi-signature identity management
